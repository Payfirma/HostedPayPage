## How to get HPP URL

### 1. POST Request

```
 Method: POST
 URL: you can find this URL in PayHQ - Settings - Hosted Pay Page
 Header: {
    Authorization: Bearer <provided access token>
    Content-Type: application/json
 }
 Body: {
    amount:
    currency:
    domain:
    tax:
    shipping_charge:
    state:
    custom_id
 }
```
#### Request Body
| Field | Required |  Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| amount | Yes | Tax, shipping_charge excluded |
| currency | Yes | CAD or USD |
| domain | Yes | Domain registered in PayHQ - Settings - Hosted Pay Page when you setup (ex. https://example.com) |
| tax | No | Tax amount you want to charge |
| shipping_charge | No | Shipping amount you want to charge |
| state | No | Whatever you want to get back after a transaction in a redirect URL(ex. your own transaction id or product id). *Note. not saved in Payfirma side* |
| custom_id | No | Keep track of transactions and for future accounting reconciliation |

### 2. How the Redirect URL looks like

Assuming your redirect URL registered in the PayHQ Settings HostedPayPage page is ‘https://example.com/redirect’.
```
 Body: {
    amount:10.00
    currency: CAD
    domain:https://example.com
    state:Product1
 }
```
### Redirect URL after the transaction
`https://example.com/redirect?result=APPROVED&lookup_id=w7Kjaxy51kX82y4vYVDO&state=Product1`

The browser will redirect a user to this URL

- *result* will be one of the following statuses

| Status |
| ----------- | 
| APPROVED | - |
| DECLINED | - |
| CANCELED | - |
 
- *lookup_id* will be always changed since it’s an transaction ID
 
- *state* will be whatever you have included in the request for initializing HPP Transaction

- You can see how the transaction went through with ***result***,
- You can use your own identifier what the transaction was about with ***state***
- You can use ***lookup_id*** to fetch the transaction information from the Payfirma side for any purposes you may have in the future.

### 3. How to use *lookup_id* to get transaction data through Payfirma API
```
 Method: GET
 URL:  https://apigateway.payfirma.com/transaction-service/transaction/lookup/<lookup_id>
 Header: {
    Authorization: Bearer <provided access token>
    Content-Type: application/json
 }
 ```
